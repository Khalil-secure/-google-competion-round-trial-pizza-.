# 🍕 Google Programming Competition – Pizza Optimization Challenge
As part of a team of three, I participated in a Google coding competition where we tackled a problem centered around optimizing pizza ingredients based on client preferences.

🧠 Problem Overview:
Each client had a list of liked and disliked ingredients.
The goal was to maximize client satisfaction by selecting a combination of ingredients that pleased as many clients as possible.
A client was satisfied if all their liked ingredients were included and none of their disliked ingredients were present.

💡 My Contributions:
Designed a scoring algorithm to evaluate ingredient combinations based on client satisfaction.
Implemented a greedy and iterative refinement strategy to test and improve ingredient sets.
Used data structures like sets and dictionaries to efficiently manage preferences and compute scores.
Collaborated with teammates to test edge cases and optimize runtime under competition constraints.


🚀 Key Takeaways:
Learned how to balance algorithmic efficiency with real-world logic (taste preferences).
Gained experience in team-based problem solving under time pressure.
Developed a deeper appreciation for heuristic approaches in optimization problems.
